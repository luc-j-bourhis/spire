/**
 * The infamous BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra System)
 *
 * This provides the basic vector-vector, matrix-vector and matrix-matrix
 * operations that linear algebra algorithms require for their implementation.
 * They are classified in level 1, level 2 and level 3.
 *
 * The FORTRAN BLAS function declarations are altered as follow:
 *   - we remove only the leading character (S, D, Z) indicating the type
 *     of elements, therefore keeping the next 2 characters indicating the type
 *     of matrices (GE for general, SY for symmetric, TR for triangular, ...);
 *   - we pass [[scala.collection.mutable.IndexedSeq]],
 *     [[spire.matrix.dense.VectorLike]] and [[spire.matrix.dense.MatrixLike]]
 *     objects as arguments instead of raw pointers along with sizes, strides
 *     or leading dimensions as those are encapsulated in the arguments in our
 *     design;
 *   - dummy CHARACTER*1 parameters are coded with enumerations instead.
