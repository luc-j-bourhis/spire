/**
 * LU decomposition of a general rectangular matrix
 *
 * Mathematically, the decomposition of a m x n matrix A reads
 *
 * A = P L U
 *
 * where P is a permutation matrix,  L is lower triangular with unit diagonal
 * elements (lower trapezoidal if m > n), and U is upper triangular (upper
 * trapezoidal if m < n). This decomposition is stored in the matrix lu as
 * follow:
 *  - L is stored below the diagonal of lu (the unit diagonal is not stored)
 *  - U is stored above the diagonal of lu, using the diagonal of lu
 *  - P is encoded in an array p following the convention that
 *    row i of the matrix was interchanged with row p(i); that array p is
 *    stored in member permutation.
 *
 * This class does not provide the mean to construct such a decomposition,
 * only to store a decomposition and perform operations on it (such as
 * solving a system of equations e.g.)
